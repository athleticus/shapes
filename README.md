## Visualizers

### Morley's Miracle (Trisector Theorem) + Extension
The closest intersections of the tri-sections of each of any triangle's interior angles will form an equilateral triangle.

## TODO
* Clean up Morley's Miracle code; separate calculations from view logic.
* Investigate point compatibility with tkinter without needing to convert to tuple.
